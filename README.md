This project analyzes a dataset provided by a food store in Pakistan dated between September 17, 2014, and October 26, 2014 (6 weeks approx.) to understand customer churn behavior. The dataset involves only three columns, and each row represents the purchasing done by customers in each day.

The dataset (Retail_Customer.csv.zip) provided for this project has a total of 1058198 rows and includes the following columns:
- customer_id: unique identifier for each customer
- date: date of purchase
- sales: total sales amount for the purchase
The reference date is the last date of the 5th week, and a customer will churn if he/she has no visit in a week.
